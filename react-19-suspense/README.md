# React 19 and suspense with React Query

This repo showcases the behaviour of Suspense with React 19 and React Query. If you look at the console or the network tab, you will notice a request waterfall.

At the time of writing you need to `npm i --force` this, as the peer dep of RQ seems to be React 18.
